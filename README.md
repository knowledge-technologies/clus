# CLUS Software from Department of Knowledge Technologies, Jo≈æef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia.

CLUS is a decision tree and rule induction software that implements the predictive clustering framework.
This framework combines clustering with predictive modelling and allows for a natural extension to more complex prediction tasks. 

CLUS is able to solve tasks such as (hierarchical) multi-label classification, (hierarchical) multi-target regression, network regression, and tasks with even more complex output types such as tuples and sets. In addition to this, ensemble learning, feature ranking and semi-supervised learning methods are also included. The software is available as a standalone tool.
